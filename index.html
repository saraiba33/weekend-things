      <p>This weekend I worked around my farm. The weather was pretty crazy all week leading up to the weekend. The majority of the week was warm and sunny but going into the weekend it got super cold and snowy. I had to contend with the weather and take care of the animals. </p>

      <p>Friday night, my girlfriend and I had our first “Buffet Friday”.
        If you don’t know what that is, it’s where you get food from multiple restaurants and eat a little bit of it all.
        Saturday, we attempted to go to the shooting range, but I had a flat tire, and we couldn’t go. Sunday, we went to 
        The Control Room and sat outside to enjoy the weather with a couple of drinks.
